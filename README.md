# MyEvents

MyEvents is a simple event system, made with MEAN Stack (MongoDB + Express + Angular + Node.js). In fact, it's my first time learning and developing using these technologies.

- Front-end is done using [Angular](https://angular.io/) (with [ngx-materialize](https://sherweb.github.io/ngx-materialize/home) to use Materialize.js styles)
- Back-end is done using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) (for authenticating users)
- Database is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), using [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to comunicate with Node
- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) is SO useful to do things with dates and timestamps
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are used to maintain the environments
